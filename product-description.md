## Main Overview

This release contains information on smoothed U.S. recession probabilities. The probabilities are obtained from dynamic-factor markov-switching model and consists of four variables: non-farm payroll employment, the index of industrial production, real personal income excluding transfer payments, and real manufacturing and trade sales.

The included data is provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) platform, which contains information on over 700,000+ series related to historical economic data.
